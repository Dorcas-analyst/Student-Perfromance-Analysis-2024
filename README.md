## 📌 Overview
As I explored the dataset using only Excel, patterns slowly began to reveal themselves: students who excelled not because they were “naturally gifted,” but because of support systems, preparation, nutrition, or parental education. Some succeeded quietly. Some struggled despite effort. And some soared once they completed the test preparation course.
This report tells that story: It shows what truly influences the performance of Harvard University students—not just grades, but human factors like gender, race, family background, and access to learning opportunities.
The goal of this analysis is to uncover evidence-based insights that any school—elite or not—can use to help students thrive.
